Instructions for running the code:

1) Ensure that the correct version of Java (openJDK 22) is installed before running the code.
2) When trying to reproduce the creation of the graphs, make sure the Java code is executed first to write the collected data into a .csv file.
3) After the Java completes execution, a csv file will be created.
4) Once this is done, run the provided python file (\analysis\plotResults.py) to create graphs from the data in the .csv.
